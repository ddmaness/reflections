What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a .git file that stores the metadata for the repository.
without this their is no way for git to perform version control.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only those files that you would like to be part of the
staging area.  They have not yet been committed in the repository.  This allows you
to selectively commit files from a directory instead of being forced to commit all or none
in the repository.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by comparing the staging area to commit 1 in the respository using the command git diff --staged
